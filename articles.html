      <h2><font color="WHITE"><u>Problems faced by the current population</u></font></h2>
      <p><font color="WHITE">One of the major problems the world is facing is the problem of the exponential growth of the population. This problem is the greatest one. Most countries in the world are showing a steep rise in population figures. The world’s resources are limited and so they cannot support a population beyond a certain limit. There has been news about the scarcity of food grains and the paucity of jobs mounting across the world. The number of human beings is multiplying at a steady rate. The world population has already crossed the six billion mark and it is expected to double in the next three or four decades.


        If the population continues to grow at this rate then the economy of the overpopulated countries will be unable to cope up with the growth of the population. Every attempt to bring peace, comfort and welfare to everybody’s door will be thwarted and misery will become prominent if the population is not kept within proper limits. Except for a few countries, all countries are facing a population boom. Currently, the largest populated country in the world is China and India is the second-largest populated country. India represents 17% of the world’s population. Other countries like Bangladesh, Japan, Indonesia and some countries of Europe are threatened to be burst into the seams by population explosion.</p>

      <h2><font color="WHITE"><u>Problems faced by the youth of the world</u></h2>
      <p><font color="WHITE">Today the major issue faced by youth is unemployment and inadequate opportunities.
        Though the government and private are creating the opportunities, but it is still inadequate with the increase in no of people seeking employment.
        There is also a gap between the skills required and resources available.
        Many young people cannot find jobs, even after they have graduated from university. This is a big problem because it means that they cannot start their careers and earn money to support themselves.
        Another challenge that the youth are facing is mental health issues.
        Social media use can also negatively affect teens, distracting them, disrupting their sleep, and exposing them to bullying, rumor spreading, unrealistic views of other people's lives and peer pressure.
        The risks might be related to how much social media teens use.
        The youth in India also face various social problems such as substance abuse, violence, crime, radicalization, communalism, and gender discrimination.
        Most difficult challenge facing India is poverty. Poverty is a significant challenge in India today. After many years of independence, India still has many poor people</p>
